# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2025
**Today's Progress**: Finished the introduction part of the Foundations Course of TOP

**Thoughts:** I did the assigned readings and videos that I did not finish yesterday, they were great at giving a positive mindset going into the next part of the lesson. I will attach the links to the TED talks that I found the most helpful. Today was great, just the introductory parts tho. I may start with the lesson 1 after committing this md

### Day 2: Februaru 19, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Finished 2 chapters in TOP; _Unrelated:_ installed ubuntu for a VM and fixed the vs code compiler for running C

**Thoughts:** I did not want to do TOP today because I took so much time fixing my VS Code, but all's well that ends well. I'm proud of myself for pushing through the lessons. _Personal achievement:_ I finally pierced my ears today! 2 additional!!
