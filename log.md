# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introduction part of the Foundations Course of TOP

**Thoughts:** I did the assigned readings and videos that I did not finish yesterday, they were great at giving a positive mindset going into the next part of the lesson. I will attach the links to the ted talks that I found the most helpful. Today was great, just the introductory parts tho. I may start with the lesson 1 after committing this md
