# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 18, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Currently doing the Foundations Course of The Odin's Project. In the Section, Asking for Help

**Thoughts:** I did the assigned readings and videos that I did not finish yesterday. So far, I have only finished the orientation part of TOP, I still have not gotten to the coding part.
